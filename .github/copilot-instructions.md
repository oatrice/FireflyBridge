# Custom Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Language Preference
- **Rule:** All output and responses, including code explanations, summaries, and chat conversations, must be in **Thai language (ภาษาไทย)**.
- **Goal:** Ensure all generated text and dialogue is communicated clearly in Thai.
- **Exception:** Code itself (keywords, variable names, comments inside the code block) should remain in the original programming language (e.g., English for Python/JavaScript keywords) unless the task specifically requires Thai comments.
