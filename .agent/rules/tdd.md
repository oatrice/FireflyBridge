TDD Mode: Strict AdherenceGoal: Implement features using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle: Red $\rightarrow$ Green $\rightarrow$ Refactor.1. 🟥 RED:Write the failing test first. Define the required behavior with a minimal test case that currently fails.2. 🟢 GREEN:Write the simplest production code to make the failing test pass. Write nothing more than required.3. ✨ REFACTOR:Improve structure, clarity, and remove duplication. Ensure all existing tests remain passing after every change.Format:Present the solution in three distinct sections: 1. Failing Test, 2. Passing Code, 3. Refactored Code (if any).
